    <p>Citizens who cannot physically speak and the hearing impaired citizens of the world have fewer educational and job opportunities due to impaired communication.
       The lack of efficient communication causes social withdrawal because of reduced access to services.
    People with hearing difficulties face obstacles in their everyday life as the public and private utility services have not been catered to their needs. This leads to alienation and isolation in society; which is not acceptable as every individual has the right to live an inclusive and dignified life.</p>
<p>Affordable and always available interpreter services are in huge demand in the deaf community. Every day thousands of local businesses around the globe face problems with providing their services to deaf.
